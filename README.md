This project will include most of the topics we have learnt so far.
This repository includes a basic skeleton with automated tests, use it for you submissions.
In this project you will create a Todo List Web Application, in which the user can store prioritized _todo tasks_ and view/sort that list


Goal (only functionality):

## Running tests
We have created automated tests for your convenience, use it to check your progression.

Note that the automated tests rely on your code having the exact class names and Ids as specified below.
Feel free to add your own.

To run the tests simply run
```
$ npm run test
```



## Requirements 
- The web app should have a heading
- The web app should have two sections: Control section and View section
- The control section is where the user adds his todo task and priority, and should have three elements:
  - [\<input\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) with id `textInput`.
  - [\<select\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) with id `prioritySelector` (options will be: 1-5).
  - [\<button\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) with id `addButton`.
- The View section is where we display the list of added todo tasks and data and should start empty. Each added todo should be inserted to the list.
- After the user click on add button you need to "reset" the input value
- Every todo item should have "container" div with class `todoContainer` that will contain 3 elements:
  - An element with a class `todoText` with the text of the todo task
  - An element with a class `todoCreatedAt` that will hold the creation time of the task in a [SQL format](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_dates.asp#:~:text=SQL%20Date%20Data%20Types&text=DATE%20%2D%20format%20YYYY%2DMM%2D,YEAR%20%2D%20format%20YYYY%20or%20YY)
  - An element for showing the numeric priority of the task, with a class `todoPriority`

  Good way üëçüèø:
  ```
    <div class="todoContainer">
      <div class="priority">
        1
      </div>
      <div class="todoCreatedAt">
        2020-06-18 11:51:12
      </div>
      <div class="todoText">
        the todo text
      </div>
    </div>
  ```

  Bad way üëéüèø:
  ```
    <div class="todoContainer">
      <div class="priority">
        1
      </div>
      <div class="todoCreatedAt">
        2020-06-18 11:51:12
      </div>
      <div class="todoText">
        <span>the todo text</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  ```
- Add a counter element to reflect the **current** number of todos stored in the app. This element should have a id `counter`.

- Add a button with id `sortButton`. Clicking this element should resort the todo list by their todos priority (DESC)
